Originally, the DAT/Artathon was an in-person event at [Understanding Risk 2020](https://understandrisk.org/event/ur2020). Community is one thing we desparately need during this time of social isolation and global separation, so we decided to move it to a virtual platform.

The event evolved into a free virtual workshop for 5-10 early career individuals who work on data visualization using disaster risk and resilience data. The artathonâ€™s goal was to form a cohesive cohort of people who can share specific skills and support one another on individual visualization projects. Read more about the inaugural event [here](link). 

Moving forward, our mission is to create more ways to connect early career individuals at the intersection of risk and resilience, data, and art.
