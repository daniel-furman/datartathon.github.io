Introducing the DAT/Artathon, a free virtual workshop for 5-10 *early career* individuals who work on data visualization using disaster risk and resilience data. The artathon’s goal is to form a cohesive cohort of people who can share specific skills and support one another on individual visualization projects.<

### What you’ll accomplish

Finish your individual viz project, document risk viz best practices, and build a burgeoning cohort of close friends & experienced risk visualizers.


### What you’ll need
A  project idea (plus a cleaned dataset and software to complete it) and a skill to share with the group.

### Save the date 
##### July 20- August 7, 2020

We will meet for 3 sessions the first week, and 1 session per week for the following two weeks. Each session will be 2 hours via a virtual platform. 

### How to apply

Submit your application [here](https://forms.gle/iBWJz4BwycGbSmjC6) by June 25 @11:59pm PDT. We will send out acceptance decisions in late June.


# How the DAT/Artathon came to be

<img src = "assets/images/datartathon/sabyol.jpg"/>

Originally, the DAT/Artathon was an in-person event at [Understanding Risk 2020](https://understandrisk.org/event/ur2020). Community is one thing we desparately need during this time of social isolation and global separation, so we decided to move it to a virtual platform.
