Corinne is a PhD candidate at Stanford University working to better understand and mitigate repetitive flooding driven by atmospheric rivers. She comes from a structural engineering background, but her work now falls at the intersection of meteorology, hydrology, and engineering risk analysis. Her passion is combining data analysis and visualization tools with this broad domain knowledge to communicate natural hazard risk at the community scale.
