Dr. Cynthia Lee is an Assistant Professor of Civil Engineering at The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art in New York City. Her research interests are in probabilistic methods for analyzing civil infrastructure and community resilience and in particular, the impact of infrastructure interdependencies on disaster preparedness and response. She is also passionate about undergraduate education and giving students in-class opportunities to see the impacts of the civil engineering field across society. 

Dr. Lee received her doctorate from Georgia Tech, a master's degree from Stanford University, and a bachelor's from Tufts University, all in civil engineering. During her Ph.D., Dr. Lee received a first-place paper award in infrastructure at Resilience Week 2018, completed Georgia Tech's Tech to Teaching certification program, and participated in several workshops for promoting diversity and interdisciplinary collaboration in research and academia. At Cooper Union, she teaches undergraduate design and experimental research courses, engineering mechanics, and structural analysis.
