Haley is a Structural Analyst within the Advanced Technology and Research team at multi-disciplinary engineering firm Arup. Her work involves quantifying the impact of hazards (both natural and manmade) on the built environment. Sitting at the intersection of the natural world and infrastructure, this work involves understanding patterns of hazard occurrence, analyzing and quantifying damages, proposing mitigations to enhance resiliency, and providing guidance on how to financially prioritize resiliency investment. Formally trained as a structural engineer, Haley holds both undergraduate and masters degrees in Structural Engineering from Stanford University and spent the first part of her career doing seismic engineering involving nonlinear and finite element analysis. Since becoming a risk and resiliency analyst, Haley has helped communicate risk to human life and building assets to large data center and tech clients, universities, and public entities.
