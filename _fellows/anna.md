Anna is a current undergraduate at Tufts University studying Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. She is interested in using data science and analytics to quantify risks and look at their societal impacts. Anna is currently working as a research assistant on a joint project with the graduate Fletcher Schoolâ€™s Climate Policy Lab in which she is using data science techniques to research the efficiency of efforts for renewable energy and their impact on social and geographic equity, inclusion, and job creation. She is specifically analyzing correlations between who receives renewable energy tax credits and their income levels along with correlations between clean energy job creation and geographic location. Additionally, this summer Anna is working in a Umass Amherst group with four professors and three students researching how the social cost of carbon is calculated and equity weighting.
