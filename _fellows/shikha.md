Shikha Srinivas is a master’s student studying Sustainable Design and Construction at Stanford University, where she also graduated from with a B.S. in Environmental Systems Engineering and Minor in Human Rights in 2021. Growing up California’s central valley, she is interested in using data to support equitable infrastructure development and community engagement in the face of climate change and urbanization. Her interest in disaster resilience and data analytics stems from working with real-time data platforms at the U.S. Green Buildings Council and using data visualization to explore urban planning decisions through the Stanford Future Bay Initiative program. She is currently a Community Resilience Data intern at Re-Public, a cloud-based, mapping platform that connects people, infrastructure and hazards. She is working on connecting social vulnerability indicators to various measures of flooding and hazard risk.
