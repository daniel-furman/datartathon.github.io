Dr. Patrick Shane Crawford is a National Research Council Postdoctoral Fellow and Research Structural Engineer in the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Community Resilience Group and Disaster and Failure Studies Program. Dr. Crawford’s research interests are in advancing field study techniques by synthesizing new technologies in remote sensing, GIS, and machine learning, and using field data to develop methods for measurement and modeling of community impacts, recovery, and resilience to hazards. This research aims to enhance resilience by informing decisions regarding building codes and standards as well as impact engineering practice.
