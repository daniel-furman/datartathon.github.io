Jackie applies disaster science to create practical disaster resilience solutions. She focuses on a “bottom line” approach to identify knowledge gaps, measurable impacts, and actionable next steps for stakeholder-led resilience in a financially sustainable way. Presently, she is researching the needs of children in disasters by assessing the local impacts of federal and state disaster policies. She is also researching the role of the private and financial sectors in disaster resilience, particularly by assessing credit risk rating methodologies in the municipal bond market. Prior to this, she coordinated long-term recovery in the non-profit sector after Hurricane Sandy, and conducted remote sensing hazard mapping for locally-led volcanic resilience strategies in Ecuador.
