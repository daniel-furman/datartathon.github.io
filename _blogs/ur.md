We're happy to announce that we will be hosting a one-hour session during this year's [2020 Understanding Risk Forum](https://understandrisk.org/event/ur2020_forum/). 

DAT/Artathon: Turning risk data into visual art

Thursday, Dec 03, UTC 02:00 to 02:55

**Organizer: University of New Mexico, Stanford Urban Resilience Initiative, Earth Observatory of Singapore**

Data art has the power to evoke emotions while simultaneously conveying information on risk and resilience to a wider audience. Risk data is often trapped in long reports and articles that never reach key stakeholders who we truly want to reach: at-risk communities and leaders who can invoke positive change. How can we support young professionals and early career researchers who want to bridge this divide?

Join us as we share the outputs from the 2020 Risk and Resilience DAT/Artathon–a collaborative and constructive virtual workshop to create disaster data art and identify best practices in data visualization when using disaster data. 

This 3-week virtual workshop brought together a cohort of early career risk and resilience data visualizers to share skills, build an inclusive cohort, and work on their own individual projects. We will feature projects from the DAT/Artathon workshop and engage in a lively panel discussion with members of this year’s cohort.
